    Jake Rosenberg. My major is Information Management and technology. I am interested in cyber security. I am great at working with others and I am also a good problem solver. My hobbies outside of school are hanging with friends, watching sports, or going to the gym. I have 2 siblings who are 29 and 24 years old. My favorite tv show is suits and the office. I am excited to be in IST 263 and learn more about making websites
