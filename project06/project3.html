            Game one was vs. the Dallas Cowboys. The game's final result was 40-0 in the favorite of the Dallas Cowboys. The game was prime time at 8 p.m. with heavy rain at MetLife stadium. The Giants got the ball first and drove down the field. They failed to convert a 3rd down in the red zone and attempted a field goal by Gram Geno. The kick was black, and the Cowboy returned the blocked kick to the end zone. At this moment in the game, the momentum completely switches. From that moment on, it was all Cowboys. The Giant's defense could not get off the field and was letting the Cowboys run all over them. Whenever the Giants were on the Field, they did not flow on offense and never created a good-looking offensive drive. The Giants only had 171 total yards, and 108 were rushing yards. The Giants also had three turnovers. The Giants came into this game with a lot of hype going into the season and disappointed all fans. This was a rough first game for New York. The Giants came out of this game with one injury, but it was to star offense line man Andrew Thomas. He had a hamstring injury is and likely to miss game 2 vs. the Cardinals.

            Game two was vs. the Arizona Cardinals and was supposed to be a bounce-back game for the Giants. It was, but it took work. The result of the Game was 31-28 in favor of the New York Giants. The first half of this game started like their first game vs. the Cowboys. The Cardinals dominated the Giants in all aspects of the football game. The Giants could not get anything going and allowed the Cardinals to score 20 points in the first half. At half, the Giants were losing 20-0 in favor of the Cardinals. The Giants were outscored 60-0 in their first six quarters of the 2023 NFL season, but something was said at halftime. The Giants came out firing on all cylinders and started to mount a comeback. The Giants came out of the half with Danial Jones throwing a major deep ball to the rookie wide receiver Jalin Hyatt. This changed the game completely. The Giants started scoring on every drive of the second half and started to stop the Cardinal's offense. The Giants returned from down 20 to win the game by 3 points. This was one of the most significant comebacks in the Giants franchise history. The comeback was led by Daniel Jones, who threw for 321 years, threw two touchdowns, and rushed for one in the second half. The Giants winning this game was significant for them to show they can be competitive. The Giants did, though, suffer some injuries during this game. Star Running back Saquon Barkley went down with a High Ankle Sprain, and offense lineman Ben Bredeson also sustained a concussion.

            Game three was vs. the San Francisco 49ers. The final result of this game was 30-12 in favor of the 49ers. The score of this game did not represent the quality of the game. It was a very close game until it got out of hand. The Giants came into this game short-handed without the presence of star running back Saquon Barkley and started offense lineman Andrew Thomas. The game was very close for the first three quarters. The Giants looked good at the start, holding the 49ers to a field goal and then coming back down the field and scoring one of their own. The Giants started to fall apart, with the game going into half 17-6 49ers leading. The Giants jumped to mount a comeback again, with the game being 20-12, still the 49ers leading. The Giants had the ball in a one-possession match but failed to make a good drive. They ended up giving the ball back to the 49ers, where they scored another touchdown, and that was when the game fell apart. The Giants proved that they can compete with top teams like the 49ers. They need to be a little more healthy. Daniel Jones only threw for 137 yards with one interception. He was pressured the whole game because the offense line was very beat up. Daniel Jones is now 1-11 in prime times games, which is becoming a significant issue for him. The Giants did have some injuries during this game, with rookie cornerback Deonte Banks hurting his arms, and D.J Davidson also went out with an elbow injury. The Giants now have a lot of breaks between this Thursday night game and their next game, which is on Monday, October 2. Hopefully, the Giants can heal up and win this game because it is almost a must-win game.
